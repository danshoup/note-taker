## Acceptance Criteria

- When opened, a landing page is shown with a link to the notes page, which, in turn, takes the user to another page, with saved notes on one side, and a place to take new notes on the right side. 

- When a new note is entered, a save button appears and the note is saved by clicking on the button; It then appears in the left-hand column with the other saved notes.

- Clicking on a saved note in the left column moves it to the right column. An icon at the top of the page, when clicked, clears the input fields and sets them up for taking a new note.

- Application front end must connect to an Express.js back end, and back end must store notes with unique IDs in a JSON file.

- Application must be deployed to Heroku

- Application must be deployed at a live URL, and load with no errors.

- GitHub URL must be submitted, and the repository must contain the application code.

- Application console is free of errors.

- Repository has a unique name and follows best practices for naming, indentation, comments, and contains descriptive commit messages.  The repository also contains a quality READMY file with description, screenshot,a nd link to deployed application.

- BONUS: Application allows users to delete notes.

- URL of the functional, deployed application, and the URL of the GitHub repository must be submitted.
